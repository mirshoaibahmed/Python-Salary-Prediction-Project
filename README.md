# [Project Title]

A data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting salary using Python.

## Project Description

This project involves a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to building and evaluating a machine learning model. The goal is to predict an individual's salary based on features such as age, years of experience, job title, and country.

## Technologies and Libraries

* **Python:** The core programming language used.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment where the analysis was conducted.
* **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** Used for data visualization to explore trends and distributions.
* **Scikit-learn:** Used to build and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Dataset

The project uses the `Salary.csv` dataset, which contains information on various individuals, including their age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary.

## Key Steps & Analysis

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The initial data was loaded using Pandas. Missing values were handled by filling them with the median of the respective columns, and duplicate records were removed to ensure data integrity.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of key features, such as "Age" and "Years of Experience."
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Categorical features were converted into numerical representations suitable for the machine learning model.
4.  **Model Building:** A Naive Bayes classifier from the scikit-learn library was used to predict salary.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was rigorously tested using **10-fold cross-validation** to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Results

The model achieved an average accuracy of [Insert your average accuracy here from the notebook output] across 10 folds, demonstrating its predictive capability.
